# Notes aggregate box simulation
## Introduction

## Goal
The goal of this model is to simulate (suspended or on microcarrier) muscle cell aggregation in a cubic domain under influence of random walk movement and fluid flow.

## Planning
- Set simulation domain and agent parameters
- Implement random walk
- Implement fluid flow
